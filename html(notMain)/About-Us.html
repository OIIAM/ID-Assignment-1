          <p>The line-up of the future seven-member girl group would be chosen through Sixteen, a competition survival program that will appear on Mnet later that year, according to J. Y. Park, the creator of JYPE, who made the announcement on February 11th, 2015. Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, and Chaeyoung were chosen as the seven Twice members for the show, which aired from May 5 till July 7. Then, Park declared that he would expand the group from seven to nine members by including Tzuyu, who was known as the "audience's pick" because she ended up being the most well-liked contestant, and Momo, who was added by Park because he believed the group needed someone with Momo's performance skills.</p>
